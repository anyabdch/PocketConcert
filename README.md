# PocketConcert
A Spotify based app!

You ever buy a ticket for a festival or concert knowing you're familiar with exactly one song from one artist? This simple but exciting web app is based off of an idea a good friend of mine had about a year ago. Users can supply the name of a concert or festival they're thinking of attending (or just artist(s) they like) and receive back two playlists: one with all the music in their library by the artists supplied/playing at the event and one with songs played by those artists they don't already listen to but might like. 

HOPEFUL FUTURE UPDATES:
- Users can pick to just get one of the playlists
- Users can connect their GCals to automatically get playlists based off of events in their calendar
- Users can build playlists off of past events
